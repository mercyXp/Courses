# Introduction to Database Technology

## 1. Overview

This document introduces the foundational ideas behind **Database Technology**, focusing on the concept of **Data Models** and their role in information systems. While this book only explores a portion of the broader topic, it emphasizes essential ideas for understanding and working with databases effectively.

## 2. What Is Database Technology?

According to the *Great Soviet Encyclopedia*:

> **Technology** is a collection of methods and processes used to obtain, process, or transform raw materials or products across industries; it is also a scientific discipline that develops such methods.

In the context of **information technology**, database technology refers to the structured approach to creating and managing **information systems** where a **Database Management System (DBMS)** controls long-term data storage using a **database**.

## 3. When Should You Use Database Technology?

Use database technology when the following conditions are met:

1. You need long-term storage of data about a **real or conceptual domain** (called a *subject area* or *SA*).
2. Multiple users need access to the data, including users who cannot perceive the real-world domain directly.
3. You require **structured storage**, not a disorganized data pile.
4. The domain is **dynamic** and requires updates by authorized users.
5. Most users will retrieve and transform information through a system interface.
6. Derived data should be created through **simple, universal operations**, not custom algorithms.
7. Information is primarily represented in **text and numeric formats**.

By the end of this book, readers will be able to evaluate whether database technology is appropriate for a given scenario.

## 4. Key Features of Database Systems

Database systems typically use a **data model (DM)** — a structured way to describe:

- **Objects** in the real world
- **Relationships** between them

### Common Components of a Data Model:

- Rules for valid **data structures**
- Rules for **data integrity**
- A set of **data operations**

These models help form the **database schema** and ensure data can be effectively stored, modified, and queried.

## 5. Terminology Note

In traditional sciences, a **model** is a representation based on a theory. In database technology, however, the term *"model"* refers to the theory itself — and the result of modeling is the **database**. This terminology evolved historically and is widely accepted, though unconventional.

## 6. Example: The Relational Model

The **relational model** uses **tables (relations)** to structure data:

- Each table represents an **object type** (e.g., `Person`).
- Each column is an **attribute** (e.g., `Name`, `Age`).
- Column headers define the structure of the data.

### Schema Definition

Before any data is entered, a **schema** must be defined. For example, the `Person` table might include:

| Name | Age | Height |
|------|-----|--------|

### Integrity Constraints

Rules ensure data consistency, such as:

> "Height must be a whole number between 50 and 300."

These constraints help avoid errors but do not replace human judgment about what data is accurate.

## 7. Data and Interpretation

The DBMS keeps track of the **structure** and **meaning** of the data:

- Each value is connected to a table and column.
- This **interpretation** transforms raw data into useful **information**.

Without headers and labels, data becomes a meaningless sequence of symbols.

---

## 8. Why Data Models Matter

Data models are essential for:

- Understanding what data **means**
- Organizing data effectively
- Supporting structured **data processing** and **retrieval**

In short, **data models are the key to turning data into actionable information**.

## Summary

This introduction sets the stage for deeper exploration into data modeling and database design. A solid understanding of these principles will help you build reliable, consistent, and meaningful information systems.
