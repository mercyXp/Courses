# 📘 Data Models: Lectures

## Author’s Preface

Welcome to the author's first comprehensive work on the subject of **databases**, approached from a perspective shaped by decades of theory, practice, and teaching. Although long experienced in the field, the author delayed publishing until he felt he had something truly meaningful to offer. Now, driven both by clarity of vision and the urgent need for accessible educational materials, this book has finally come to life.

## 📌 Purpose of This Book

This book aims to:

- Offer a **deep, foundational understanding** of **data models**, rather than just practical steps for working with specific Database Management Systems (DBMS).
- Present an **unconventional perspective** that may challenge readers’ current understanding—and in doing so, expand it.
- Serve as both a **learning tool** and a **reference guide**, suitable for students, researchers, and practitioners.

## 🧠 Why "Data Models" and Not Just "Databases"?

The title reflects the core focus of this work:

1. **Precision in Naming**: One of the primary skills in database design is selecting the right terminology. “Data Models” better expresses the semantic and conceptual heart of the book.
   
2. **Tribute to a Classic**: The title pays homage to the foundational book by **C. Zaniolo** and **Timos Sellis**—often referred to by the Russian transliteration “Tsikritsis and Lokhovski”—which first inspired the author’s academic journey.

3. **Depth Over Speed**: Unlike quick-start guides (e.g., "Databases in 24 Hours"), this book avoids focusing on menus and screens. Instead, it builds deep expertise in data modeling and conceptual design.

## 📚 How to Use This Book

While it can be used as a **reference manual**, readers are strongly encouraged to:

- Read the book **cover to cover**, to follow the logical progression of ideas.
- Engage deeply with the author's reasoning and explanations, even when they differ from common interpretations.
- Use it as a **course companion**—especially in academic settings—where the included slide presentations can aid lecture-based instruction.

## 🎓 Academic Context

This lecture course has been refined over **30 years** of teaching at **Tomsk State University (TSU)**. The material has been adapted across multiple departments, particularly within the **Faculty of Informatics**, and includes visual slides accompanying each lecture, similar to a live classroom experience.

## 👥 Who Should Read This Book?

This book is designed for:

- **Practitioners** who want to understand the subtle, powerful concepts that underpin good database design.
- **Theorists** looking for a clearly articulated, non-jargon-heavy explanation of core database principles.

Whether you're starting out or looking to deepen your expertise, the content within these pages can illuminate the essential truths behind data modeling and database design.

## 💡 Final Thoughts

Database management remains a field rich with both **unsolved practical challenges** and **fascinating theoretical questions**. The author hopes that this book will spark curiosity, inspire further research, and serve as a trusted guide in your journey into the world of data models.
