## Objective
The objective is to understand the factors affecting computing as we know it today and hopefully to forecast the future of computation.

## General Overview
The technological advances witnessed in the computer industry are the result of a
long chain of immense and successful efforts made by `two major forces`. These
are the `**academia**`, represented by university research centers, and the `**industry**`,
represented by computer companies. It is, however, fair to say that the current
 technological advances in the computer industry owe their inception to `university
research centers`. In order to appreciate the current technological advances in the
computer industry, one has to trace back through the `history of computers` and
their development. The objective of such historical review is to understand the
factors affecting computing as we know it today and hopefully to forecast the
future of computation. A great majority of the computers of our daily use are
known as `general purpose machines`. These are machines that are built with no
specific application in mind, but rather are capable of performing computation
needed by a diversity of applications. These machines are to be distinguished
from those built to serve (tailored to) specific applications. The latter are known
as `special purpose machines`.
